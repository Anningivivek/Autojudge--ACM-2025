⚖️ AutoJudge: Programming Problem Difficulty PredictorAutoJudge is an intelligent system that automatically predicts the difficulty level and numerical score of programming problems. By analyzing the textual content of a problem—including the description, input constraints, and output requirements—it provides an automated alternative to manual human labeling used by platforms like Codeforces and Kattis.🚀 Project OverviewThe goal is to build a tool where a user can paste a problem description and receive:Problem Class: A categorical classification (Easy, Medium, or Hard).Problem Score: A predicted numerical difficulty score.📊 DatasetThe project uses a dataset consisting of 4,112 unique programming problems.Text Features: Title, Description, Input Description, Output Description.Target Variables: problem_class and problem_score.🛠️ Technical Implementation1. Data PreprocessingText Integration: Combined the description, input, and output text fields into a single corpus.Cleaning: Implemented a robust cleaning pipeline to remove HTML tags, handle special characters, and convert text to lowercase.LaTeX Handling: Replaced complex mathematical delimiters (e.g., $...$) with a standard MATH_EXPRESSION placeholder to preserve the context of mathematical complexity without breaking the vectorizer.2. Feature ExtractionNLP Method: Utilized TF-IDF (Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency).Parameters: Extracted the top 2,500 features while removing standard English stop words to focus on meaningful programming keywords.3. Machine Learning ModelsBased on model evaluation, Random Forest was selected as the final architecture for both tasks:Classification: Random Forest Classifier.Regression: Random Forest Regressor.📈 Performance ResultsBased on the latest test run, the models achieved the following metrics:TaskModelPerformance MetricClassificationRandom Forest50% AccuracyRegressionRandom Forest1.73 MAE (Mean Absolute Error)RegressionRandom Forest2.07 RMSE (Root Mean Squared Error)💻 UsageLocal InstallationInstall dependencies:Bashpip install pandas numpy scikit-learn nltk streamlit
